DESCRIPTION
-----------
This function computes the following DSC metrics:
    CBF : numerically calculated as the maximum value of the tissue residue function  𝑅(𝑡) , where  𝑅(𝑡)  is related to the tissue concentration  𝐶(𝑡) , and the AIF  𝐶𝑎(𝑡)  by:  𝐶(𝑡)  =  𝐹.𝐶𝑎(𝑡)∗𝑅(𝑡) 
    CBV : numerically calculated as the area under the curve of the  Δ𝑅∗2  time curve
    MTT : numerically calculated as the ratio of CBV and CBF based on the Central Volume Theorem
